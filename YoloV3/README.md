### YOLOv3 (You only look once)

[YoloV3](YOLOv3.pdf) is an updated version of the original [Yolo](YOLO.pdf).
Easy implementation of the pre-trained yolov3 can be  found on the [YOLO](https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo/) website. Also, easy steps to train it on selected datasets are given on the website. 

- I forked the original repository, darknet having c++ implementation and all the necessary files for the implementation of pre-trained model - [GuptaAbhinavv/darknet](https://github.com/GuptaAbhinavv/darknet)

- Implementation of YoloV3 using OpenCV in python based on [this](https://www.learnopencv.com/deep-learning-based-object-detection-using-yolov3-with-opencv-python-c/). Find the google colab notebook here.
