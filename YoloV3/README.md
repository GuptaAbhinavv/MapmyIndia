#### This is in reference to the [YoloV3](https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo/) website.

[YoloV3](YOLOv3.pdf) is an updated version of the original [Yolo](YOLO.pdf).
Easy implementation of the pre-trained yolov3 can be  found on the above website. Also, easy steps to train it on selected datasets are given on the website. 

I forked the original repository, darknet having c++ implementation and all the necessary files for the implementation of pre-trained model - [GuptaAbhinavv/darknet](https://github.com/GuptaAbhinavv/darknet)
